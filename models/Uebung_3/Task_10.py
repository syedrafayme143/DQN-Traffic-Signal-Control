Qualitative Comparison (Task 10):

The volume_lane_fast representation (1st graph) shows faster convergence with smoother reward improvement 
and fewer deep reward drops, indicating more stable and efficient learning. In contrast, the congestion_length 
representation (2nd graph) exhibits more volatility and slower convergence, suggesting it may provide less 
informative or noisier input for the agent’s decision-making process.
